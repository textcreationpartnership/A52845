         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This ſcurrilous Libeller (as ſuſpecting his own ſtrength in his Eſſay) doth ſupplie with Policy his want of power and proweſs.
<q xml:lang="lat">Dolus an virtus, quis in hoſte requirat?</q>
            </p>
            <p>He therefore firſt ſingleth out the Noble Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (that brave Patriot for his King and Kingdom,) as <hi>their</hi> Forlorn Hope, which could he but rout, then will he fall foul upon the main Body, that ſtood in a double File, or two in a Rank behind him. And in purſuance of this project he firſt aſſaults that ſingle Earl, with ſubtile Inſinuations, dipping his Nail (he had to drive) in Oil, to make it drive the deeper, not only to the Head, but to the Heart alſo. Thus like the Devil, he accoſts the Earl with <hi>Flattering,</hi> before he come to his <hi>Frowning</hi> Work, which he comes to in the ſecond place. Not only frowning upon the Earl, in telling him that he threatens his Majeſty (which his humble offer of Advice (as he ſaith there) can in no Grammatical ſence without notorious wreſting be ſo interpreted) but alſo in giving that Noble Peer <hi>(Tantamont)</hi> the Lie, in upbraiding him with his weak Obſervation without the leaſt ground in Hiſtory, as if this obſcure Whiffler (aſhamed of his own Name) knew more both of the Hiſtory and Miſtery of our State than all thoſe ſixteen Lords, and all other the wiſeſt of States-men.</p>
            <p>However, he craftily quotes <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chronicle only, and becauſe he there found nothing of the Parliament at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the II.'s Time, therefore he affronts the Earl with telling an Untruth: and he ſaith, the cauſe of that King's Unhappineſs was from <hi>ambitious</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Grandees:</hi> But had he conſulted <hi>Fuller's Church Hiſtory, Cent.</hi> 12. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 32. and <hi>Prideaux</hi>'s Introduction, <hi>pag.</hi> 319. <hi>edit.</hi> 2.

            <p>As to <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. our Libeller ſhuffles that up, and never quotes <hi>Baker,</hi> (as he might have done) who tells us, how the Duke of <hi>York</hi> firſt began to whiſper for the Crown, <hi>p.</hi> 188 <hi>Col.</hi> 2. then ſecondly, made his way to the Crown, <hi>p.</hi> 190. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. After all this, takes the Oath of Allegiance to <hi>Henry</hi> the VI. <hi>p.</hi> 192. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. whom he caſt out of his Throne, (notwithſtanding his Oath of Fidelity two ſeveral times,) there being no leſs than four Changes in his Reign. But not a word of this muſt we hear from him, leſt that ſhould create the like Fears about the Duke of <hi>York</hi> at this time: For then did <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York (Edward</hi> the IV.'s Father) get it confirmed by Parliament, to be Heir Apparent of the Crown; and this is the great Conteſt of this Day. Neither doth he mention that Parliament held at <hi>Coventry,</hi> (which that Honourable Lord in his Humble Addreſs hinteth at) wherein the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was convicted of High-Treaſon, and all his Lands and Goods confiſcate to the King. This alſo had a <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> upon it, as being, like the afore-ſaid, unſuitable to his Deſign, tho his <hi>Baker,</hi> whom he only quotes, do ſpeak fully to all this, <hi>p.</hi> 196. <hi>Col.</hi>

            <p>As to the Body of the Petition, I obſerve, this Libeller is a faſt Friend to the plotting Papiſts, and would give us a Diverſion from that kind of Cattel to the Presbyterians, (whom he judges far worſe) as if he had an hand in the Meal-Tub Intrigue.</p>
